function [ hom sep mw ] = compareWithinAndBetweenGroupsSim( simMat, grouping )
%compareWithinAndBetweenGroupsSim compares similaritiy between elements
%from same group to that between elements from different groups (can be
%used to examnie correspondence with a known organization, site
%distribution etc.
%   Detailed explanation goes here
%Input: simMat - a symmetric similarity matrix in which entry i,j and j,i
%                both contain the similarity between element i and element j
%       grouping - a known partition of the elements which is to be
%                  examined (0 is treated as non group)
%Output: stats of wheather within group similarity is greater than between group similarity :
%  hom - homogeneity (average pairwise similarities) within groups 
%  sep - separation between groups (average pairwise similarities for pairs that are from different groups)
%  mw - stats from a 1 tailed Mannï¿½Whitney (Ranksum) test
